#steer-screenshot

> Take a screenshot of a google chrome window

## Installation

```sheel
npm install steer-screenshot
```

## Dependencies

You will need to install graphicsmagick since this is whats used to validate
the screenshot.

On Mac OS X with `brew` you can install it with:

```shell
brew install graphicsmagick
```

Also be sure to check out the requirements for `steer`.

## Documentation

Sometimes Chrome hits a racecondtion so it either completly fails and returns
undefined or the picture gets malformated. This module validates the picture
and retries 5 times.

```javascript
var path = require('path');
var steer = require('steer');
var screenshot = require('steer-screenshot');

var chrome = steer({
  cache: path.resolve(__dirname, 'cache'),
  inspectorPort: 7510,
  permissions: ['tabs'] // this module needs `tabs` permissions
});

chrome.once('open', function () {

  // The second argument (60) is the JPEG quality
  screenshot(chrome, 60, function (err, buffer, attemps) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('Screenshot taken after ' + attemps + ' attemps');
    fs.writeFileSync('picture.jpg', buffer);
  });
});
```
